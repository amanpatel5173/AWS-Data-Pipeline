This document provides key details about the support_tickets and support_logs tables, including their structure, relationship, and purpose.



----------------------------------------------------
Table1: support-tickets
This table captures customer support ticket data, including both resolved and unresolved cases. Each record represents a support issue logged by a user through various channels, handled by an agent with associated priority, status, and interaction count.

- ticket_id : Unique identifier for each support ticket (e.g., TCK0701011). May repeat due to duplicates or tracking.
- created_at : When the ticket was logged by the user
- resolved_at : When the issue was marked resolved (can be null if status ≠ Resolved)
- agent	: Support agent assigned or handling the ticket
- priority : Priority label: Low, Medium, High
- issue_category : Classification of the issue (e.g., Bug Report, Login Issue, Feature Request)
- num_interactions : Number of times the user or support agent interacted over the issue
- status : Current status of the ticket: Resolved, Open, or Escalated
- channel : Ticket submission channel: Email, Chat, Phone, Web Form


Status Behavior:
- Resolved : Issue closed with a resolution
- Open : Issue is pending,  awaiting resolution
- Escalated : Issue was raised to a higher support tier or team
----------------------------------------------------


Table2: support-logs
This table captures backend system logs for every ticket interaction. Each row logs an event related to a ticket (e.g., backend service hit, CPU usage, API call).

- timestamp : When the backend event occurred
- log_level : Severity level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG)
- component : Backend system component involved
- ticket_id : The same ticket ID referenced in support_tickets
- session_id : Session for the logged event
- ip : IP address of user/client
- response_time	: Time taken to respond (in milliseconds)
- cpu: 	CPU load at the time the event was logged. High values may indicate server stress.
- event_type : Type of event
- error : Whether the event recorded an error (True/False)
- user_agent : Browser or tool used for access
- message : Event message (e.g., "event for TCK0701011")
- debug : Debug message for internal use
